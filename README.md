# Bill's Ultimate Rails POC (aka BURP)

This Ruby on Rails application is a proof-of-concept application.
The master branch of this application uses SQLite for persistence.
There are four additional branches of this application each using a different backing data store:

* maria - MariaDB (i.e. MySQL w/o Oracle baggage)
* postgres - PostgreSQL
* mongo - MongoDB
* couchbase - Couchbase
